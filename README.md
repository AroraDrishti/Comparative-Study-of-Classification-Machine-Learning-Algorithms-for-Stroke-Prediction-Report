# Comparative Study of Classification Machine Learning Algorithms for Stroke Prediction Report
A stroke is a medical condition that affects the brain by rupturing the capillaries present. It can
happen when the circulation of the blood and other functioning of the brain is disrupted. WHO
cites stroke as the primary global manner of mortality and impairment. There has been some
27
research on the prognosis of heart attacks, but not much on the risk of brain attacks. With this
in mind, numerous machine learning models are deployed to predict the possibility of a stroke.

In order to build eight classification models for precise prediction, this paper took a variety of
physiological factors and used machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine, K13
Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest
Classification, Naive Bayes Classification, AdaBoost Classifier and XGBoost Classifier. The
XGBoost algorithm, which had an accuracy of about 92.75% gave the best prediction results.
